# The Rasch Model

## Column A {style="black"}

**Introduction**

*For this tutorial and associated Shiny app, we will be looking at dichotomous items only, which have only two possible response categories that are scored 0 for incorrect and 1 for correct.*

The Rasch model is used to explain the relationship between a latent trait, such as science learning, and a student's performance on a manifest variable, which is an item on a related assessment. The unit of analysis in this model is the item. In particular, the Rasch model focuses on item difficulty.

The equation for the Rasch model and key assumptions regarding its use are shown in the middle column. The far right column provides some item parameters and an item characteristic curve (ICC) plot. 

Note: For the data and plot provided the mirt package was used for the IRT analysis and the irtoys package was used to simulate dichotomous data in a matrix format.

## Key Facts

### Equations

```{r shinEq}
ui <- fluidPage(
  withMathJax(),
  helpText('The Equation for a Rasch Model'),
  uiOutput('ex1'),
  textOutput("PL"),
  actionButton(inputId = "symbols", label = "Click here")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$ex1 <- renderUI({
    withMathJax(helpText('$$p\\left(x_j = 1|\\theta,\\alpha,\\delta_j\\right) = \\frac{e^{(\\theta-\\delta_j)}}{1 + e^{(\\theta-\\delta_j)}}$$'))
  })
  observeEvent(input$symbols, {
        showModal(modalDialog(
          title = "Symbol Definitions",
          tags$head(tags$style("#shiny-modal img {max-width: 100%;}")),
           tags$img(
            src = base64enc::dataURI(file = "/Users/cassiemalcom/Desktop/CM2020/23_Winter Term Classes/EDLD 640 DS Cap/IRT4Teachers/Images/2023-02-28_14-10-27.jpg", mime = "image/jpeg"),
            alt = "Table with statistical symbols"),
          easyClose = TRUE,
          footer = NULL
        ))
  })
  output$PL <- renderText({
    paste("Note: The IPL equation only differs from the Rasch by not constraining item discrimination (Î±) to 1.")
  })
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

### Assumptions

1. Invariance - the measurement tool allows item parameters to be estimated from any location on the item response curve indicating the measurement tool is independent of what's measured
2. Local independence - student responses to different items are independent of each other on a student's location (ability level)
3. Monotonicity - as the latent trait level increases the probability of a correct response increases
4. Unidimensionality - the model assumes only the dominant latent trait is measured and that this trait impacts item responses, which indicates that observations about the manifest variables are a function of a continuous single latent trait

Simulated Data File:

```{r emsim}
# embed a single file

xfun::embed_file('/Users/cassiemalcom/Desktop/CM2020/23_Winter Term Classes/EDLD 640 DS Cap/IRT4Teachers/Data/irtSIM.csv')
```

## Interpreting Data {.tabset data-width="650"}

```{r sd1, include=FALSE}
#item discrimination (needs to be fixed to 1 for Rasch model), item difficulty, and number of items

set.seed(5878)
iSim1 <- cbind(runif(20,1,1), runif(20,0,1), rep(0,20))
head(iSim1)
```

```{r sd2, include=FALSE}
set.seed(5878)
iSim2 <- irtoys::sim(ip=iSim1, x=rnorm(30))
head(iSim2)
```

```{r renameC, include=FALSE}
#rename columns for plotting
colnames(iSim2) <- c("Item 1","Item 2","Item 3","Item 4","Item 5","Item 6","Item 7","Item 8", "Item 9", "Item 10", "Item 11", "Item 12", "Item 13", "Item 14", "Item 15", "Item 16", "Item 17", "Item 18", "Item 19", "Item 20")

head(iSim2)
```

```{r RM1, include=FALSE}
unimodel <- mirt.model("latent = 1-20")

RaMod <- mirt::mirt(data = iSim2,
               model = unimodel,  # alternatively, we could also just specify model = 1 in this case
               itemtype = "Rasch",
               SE = TRUE) # Verbose = False stops from printing the iterations
RaMod
```

### IRT Analysis

In the table below both the item discrimination parameter (alpha) and the item location parameter (delta) are provided for each of the 20 simulated items. Remember that alpha is set to 1 because of the Rasch model we are using and that delta estimates item difficulty.

A larger delta parameter indicates an item of higher difficulty. For Item 1, a student with ability level 2.1 standard deviations above the average has only a 50% chance of answering the item correctly.

```{r C}
coef.rasch <- coef(RaMod, IRTpars=TRUE, simplify=TRUE)

items.rasch <- as.data.frame(coef.rasch$items)

IR2 <- items.rasch %>% select(-c(g, u))

colnames(IR2)[1] <- "Item Discrimination Parameter"
colnames(IR2)[2] <- "Item Location Parameter"

print(IR2)
```

### ICC Plot

Item Characteristic Curve (ICC) for Item 1

Below is an item characteristic curve, which shows the probability of a student getting an item right based on a student's latent ability level (theta). A student's location is estimated on the latent ability scale, which ranges here from -4 to 4, with 0 being average/medium ability.

So for Item 1, a student with medium ability (theta = 0) in the latent trait being observed would have a probability (P) of 10% to get the item right.

```{r}
mirt::itemplot(RaMod, 1, type = "trace", shiny = FALSE, 
               par.settings = list(superpose.line = list(col = "aquamarine1")), 
               main="Item Characteristic Curve for Item 1"
               )
```
